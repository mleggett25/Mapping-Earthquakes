# Mapping Earthquakes Using Javascript, Leaflet.js, and GeoJSON Data

## Purpose
The purpose of this project was to create an earthquake map that would show earthquake data in relation to the location of tectonic plates. The map also shows all the earthquakes with a magnitude greater than 4.5.

The map can be found here: [Earthquake Map](https://www.earthquakes.michael-leggett.com/)
